# NGMI
List of projects that are not gonna make it :shit:

Anyone is open for contributions, just add project to list below and add constructive reasons why it's NGMI.

Also star this repo, we like NGMI things in crypto!

## So, NGMI projects:

### - [Unstoppable Domains](https://unstoppabledomains.com/)
Why NGMI? Because it's centralized monopolized monster made of absolute web 2 and capitalism but living in web 3.

They place their domains like domains for freedom, because "you don't have to pay renewal fees".

We need to understand truth - if you don't have to pay renewal fees, it not means that you own thing. It's like borrowing hammer from your neighbour - you don't have to pay any fees for using it, but neighbour still haves full rights for it.

Unstoppable Domains are like this neighbour - they can give you domain, but they still own it and can make everything they want with it.

Also, code of Unstoppable Domains's smart contract is completely closed - check yourself here https://github.com/orgs/unstoppabledomains/repositories?q=&type=source&language=solidity&sort=

Also their behavoir is fully unacceptable in free dWeb space: Trademarking various commonly used crypto words, including "Bitcoin" https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=97095196&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=statusSearch and lawsuiting other registrars after trademarking https://domainnamewire.com/2022/07/20/update-unstoppable-domains-sues-over-handshake-wallet-domain/.

Conclusion: NGMI, fully centralized law corpration that tries to look like web 3 developers, #StoppableDomains
